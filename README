If you need some beans to be instantiated only when a user of your application turns on some certain functionality, you can do so here.

To do so, add the plugin as a dependency to your BuildConfig.groovy:
compile ":delayed-configuration:0.1"

Next, you'll need to create a service that implements com.infinum.grails.plugins.delayedconfiguration.IDelayedConfiguration.  

In that Service, you'll have something like:

class DelayedConfigurationService implements IDelayedConfiguration {
  void configure(BeanBuilder builder, Map config){
    builder.beans {
      myBean(BeanClass)
            
      Map aConfig = config.someOptions
      if(aConfig){
        anotherBean(AnotherClass)
      }

      if(someService.returnsABoolean()){
        yetAnotherBean(YetAnotherClass){
            dependentProperty = ref('myBean')
        }
      }
  }
}

Finally, to access any of those beans in DelayedConfigurationService from your existing services, controllers, etc.  You'll have to inject the DelayedConfigurationMgmtService and access your bean with:
delayedConfigurationMgmtService.bean('myBean')
